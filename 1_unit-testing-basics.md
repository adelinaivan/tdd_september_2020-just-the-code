# Unit Test Basics

## 1. What is a unit test
Unit test = A unit test provides a written contract that a piece of code must satisfy

Example: CalculatorTest.java -> testAdd

## 2. What makes a good unit test
 - Readability - it should be clear what is the unit under test, it should be short and precise
 - Isolation - it should focus on testing a specific piece of code, not combine them
 - Specificity - when it fails it should point to the problem
 - Fast - the faster you get your results, the shorter the development cycle is
 
Let's take a loot at AdditionServiceTest and see if it complies.

## 3. Tools of the trade 
### Junit 
Junit features we will be using are showcased in: JunitBasicsExamples.java.

### Mockito
Mockito features we will be using are showcase in MockitoExamplesTest.java.

## 4. DIY
The application given to you exposes a calculation API. It is capable of adding and multiplying numbers, but only if the numbers are positive. 
The multiplication service is missing unit tests. Would you be so kind to add them ?
